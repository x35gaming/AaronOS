AaronOS Privacy Policy

Last updated: 1/26/2019

This Privacy Policy is in reguards to AaronOS, as it pertains to the official server
	hosted at https://aaron-os-mineandcraft12.c9.io/
For any who deploy AaronOS on their own, it is highly recommended that you follow a
	policy similar to this one.

I will only ever collect information that is directly relied upon to improve or work
	with AaronOS.

INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

I will try my best to never knowingly collect data that could be used to personally
	identify you. Any and all data collection I may perform will be performed
	anonymously.

Any ongoing data campaigns, at the time of writing, will be detailed in the Settings
	application, under Information -> Anonymous Data Collection. This list will
	be updated when a data collection campaign is underway, and will include a
	list of specifically what data is being collected.

PERSONAL FILES

Part of AaronOS's core functionality is that you have your own set of files hosted
	on the AaronOS server.
While it is possible for me to access this data at any time, I am holding myself to
	this policy to never access these files, except with your express permission
	or for the sake of fixing a serious issue.
If for any reason I must access these files, I will do my best to make you aware that
	this has occurred.

Keep in mind that no web security is perfect. If someone breaches my account or the
	AaronOS server, they may be able to force access to your files.
For this reason, DO NOT store any sensitive information on AaronOS. Examples include
	secrets, bank information, addresses, full names, or any other things that
	you wouldn't want people to know.

COMMUNICATIONS

I may contact you via various means (examples: email, Discord messaging).
This being said, I will do my best to never contact you without good reason.
Examples of good reason may be that you have requested that I conact you, or
	if there is an issue that requires your attention.
Note that I will not be collecting email addresses; the only way I'll know it
	is if you provide it to me for the purpose of contacting you.

COOKIES

AaronOS leverages web cookies for parts of its core functionality.
The main cookie AaronOS uses is a unique identifier that tells AaronOS what filesystem
	to grab from the server when loading aOS.
If you wish, you may instruct your browser to deny cookies from AaronOS, though do note
	that this will prevent its filesystem from persisting between sessions.

CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 1/26/2019 and will remain in effect except with
	respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect
	immediately after being posted on this page.

I reserve the right to update or change this Privacy Policy at any time, though I will
	make a reasonable effort to inform the users of AaronOS if this occurs.
